# HUSAI: Hunting for Stable AI Features

**Tagline**: *Uncovering the reproducibility crisis in sparse autoencoders and finding the path to stable, interpretable AI*

---

## The Problem Statement

### The Janeiro 2025 Bombshell

In January 2025, Paulo and Belrose dropped a bombshell on the mechanistic interpretability community: **SAE features are unstable**. When you train the same sparse autoencoder (SAE) architecture twice with different random seeds, only ~30% of features overlap between runs.

Think about what this means. The entire premise of mechanistic interpretability research relies on SAEs discovering "natural" features in neural networksâ€”the building blocks of computation that we can understand and analyze. But if these features change drastically with every training run, what are we actually discovering? Are we uncovering genuine structure in neural networks, or just finding one of many equally valid decompositions?

### Why This Matters

This isn't just an academic curiosity. The stability of SAE features has profound implications for:

**AI Safety**: If we can't reliably identify features across training runs, how can we monitor for dangerous capabilities? How can we build robust interpretability tools that work consistently?

**Scientific Validity**: Can we trust results from mechanistic interpretability papers if features aren't reproducible? Are we building a house of cards?

**Practical Applications**: Circuit discovery, feature steering, and mechanistic understanding all depend on having stable, meaningful features. Without stability, these applications become unreliable.

### Current State of the Field

The interpretability community is at a crossroads. We have powerful tools (SAEs, dictionary learning) and exciting results (finding circuits, understanding features), but we lack fundamental knowledge about when these tools actually work. Key open questions include:

- Do SAEs converge to stable features under certain conditions?
- How do different SAE architectures (ReLU, TopK, BatchTopK) compare in stability?
- What role does the training dynamics play in feature formation?
- Can we predict which features will be stable vs. unstable?

We need systematic, controlled experiments to answer these questions. That's where HUSAI comes in.

## Our Research Questions

HUSAI investigates five core questions about SAE feature stability:

### 1. The Goldilocks Zone Hypothesis
**Does there exist a "sweet spot" in hyperparameter space where SAEs converge to stable, reproducible features?**

We hypothesize that feature stability isn't binaryâ€”it exists on a spectrum controlled by factors like:
- Dictionary size (expansion factor)
- Sparsity coefficient (L1 penalty strength)
- Learning rate and training duration
- Model capacity vs. data complexity

By systematically varying these parameters, we aim to map the landscape of feature stability and identify regions where reproducibility is high.

### 2. Architecture Comparison
**How do different SAE architectures compare in terms of feature stability and quality?**

We'll compare three major architecture families:
- **ReLU-based SAEs**: The classic approach with L1 sparsity
- **TopK SAEs**: Hard sparsity via top-k activation selection
- **BatchTopK SAEs**: Batch-level top-k for training efficiency

Each architecture makes different trade-offs between sparsity, reconstruction quality, and computational efficiency. We'll measure how these trade-offs affect stability.

### 3. Circuit Recovery as Ground Truth
**Can we reliably recover known computational circuits (specifically, Fourier features in modular arithmetic)?**

Using Nanda et al.'s grokking framework, we know that transformers learn interpretable Fourier features when solving modular arithmetic (e.g., a + b mod p). This gives us ground truth: we *know* what features should exist.

By training SAEs on grokked models, we can ask:
- Do different SAE seeds discover the same Fourier features?
- How clean is the recovery (one feature per Fourier component)?
- Does stability correlate with circuit clarity?

### 4. Geometric Feature Space Structure
**What is the geometric organization of SAE feature spaces, and how does it relate to stability?**

Features don't exist in isolationâ€”they form a geometric structure in activation space. We'll investigate:
- **Feature clustering**: Do stable features cluster together?
- **Interference patterns**: How do overlapping features affect stability?
- **Dimensionality**: What's the intrinsic dimensionality of stable vs. unstable feature manifolds?
- **Conservation laws**: Are certain geometric properties preserved across seeds?

### 5. Temporal Dynamics of Feature Formation
**When during SAE training do features crystallize into stable patterns vs. diverge across seeds?**

We'll track feature evolution throughout training to understand:
- Do features start similar and diverge, or start different and sometimes converge?
- Are there critical periods where stability is determined?
- Can we detect early warning signs of instability?
- Does feature formation mirror neural network training dynamics (e.g., progressive differentiation)?

## Our Approach

### Ground Truth Testbed: Modular Arithmetic

Rather than diving into the complexity of language models, we start with a **controllable, well-understood domain**: transformers trained on modular arithmetic tasks.

**Why modular arithmetic?**
- **Known ground truth**: We know exactly what features should exist (Fourier components)
- **Perfect grokking**: Models achieve 100% accuracy and learn interpretable circuits
- **Tractable scale**: Small models (1-layer, 128d) that train in minutes
- **Rich structure**: Despite simplicity, exhibits complex phase transitions and emergence

This testbed lets us ask clean questions with definitive answers before tackling messier domains.

### Systematic Experimentation: 50+ SAE Training Runs

We'll train **50+ SAE variants** with systematic parameter sweeps:

**Architecture variations:**
- 3 SAE types (ReLU, TopK, BatchTopK)
- 3-5 expansion factors (4x, 8x, 16x, 32x, 64x)
- 3-5 sparsity levels (L1 coefficients or k values)

**Training variations:**
- 5+ random seeds per configuration
- Multiple training durations (early stopping vs. convergence)
- Different learning rates and schedules

**Measurement protocol:**
- Track training metrics (loss, sparsity, reconstruction)

## Vision: Where We're Going

Imagine a future where mechanistic interpretability is a **reliable, reproducible science**. Where we can:

- Train an SAE and trust that key features will appear consistently
- Compare results across papers knowing they used comparable methods
- Build safety tools knowing they'll work on tomorrow's models, not just today's
- Understand the fundamental structure of neural network representations

HUSAI is a small but crucial step toward that future. By understanding when and why SAE features stabilize, we're laying the groundwork for interpretability research that scalesâ€”not just to bigger models, but to bigger dreams.

This semester, we're not just running experiments. We're building the foundation for trustworthy AI understanding.

**Let's hunt for stable features. Let's make interpretability reproducible. Let's build the future of AI safety.**
