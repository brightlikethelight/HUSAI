## Dependencies & Critical Path

```
Foundation (Week 1) âœ…
    â†“
Phase 1A: Transformer (Weeks 2-4)
    â†“
Phase 1B: SAE Implementation (Weeks 5-8)
    â†“
Phase 2: Experiments (Weeks 9-13)
    â†“
Phase 3: Analysis (Weeks 14-19)
    â†“
Phase 4: Write-up (Weeks 20-25)
```

**Critical Path Items** (cannot be parallelized):
1. Transformer must complete before SAE training
2. SAE code must complete before experiment campaign
3. Experiments must complete before analysis
4. Analysis must complete before write-up

**Potential Parallelization**:
- Phase 1A and 1B can overlap slightly (start 1B infrastructure while finalizing 1A)
- Phase 3 visualization can begin while Phase 2 experiments finish
- Phase 4 write-up infrastructure can begin during Phase 3

## Resource Requirements

### Personnel
- **Primary Developer**: 1 FTE (Phase 0 lead, continues through Phase 4)
- **Research Lead**: 0.5 FTE (strategic direction, review, publication)
- **Optional**: 1 FTE (parallel work on Phase 1B during 1A, or analysis support)

### Compute Infrastructure
- **Phase 1A (Transformer)**: Single GPU (A100 or V100), ~1 week
- **Phase 1B (SAE Prototyping)**: Single GPU, ~1 week
- **Phase 2 (Experiments)**: Multi-GPU (8-16 GPUs), ~4 weeks
- **Phase 3+ (Analysis)**: CPU with high memory, standard workstation

### Estimated Compute Costs
- **Phase 1A+1B**: ~$500 (single GPU, 2 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: ~$3,000-$5,000 (50+ SAEs across 4-5 weeks)
- **Total Compute Budget**: $3,500-$5,500

## Risk Analysis

### High-Risk Items

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Phase 1A: Transformer grokking not observable | 15% | Medium | Use different learning rate schedules, check literature for working hyperparams |
| Phase 1B: Dead latents crash training | 25% | High | Extensive unit testing, start with simple cases, use proven dead latent techniques |
| Phase 2: GPU quota/availability issues | 30% | High | Use multiple cloud providers, batch submissions, backoff strategy |
| Phase 2: Cost explosion (>$5k) | 20% | Medium | Monitor closely, abort runs if needed, optimize batch sizes |
| Phase 3: Low feature consistency | 20% | Medium | Explore different distance metrics, check implementation, adjust hyperparameters |
| Hardware failure/data loss | 10% | High | Automated backups, distributed training, checkpoint versioning |

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental validation**: Test each phase before committing to next
2. **Cost controls**: Set spend limits, monitor daily, adjust as needed
3. **Backup plans**: Have contingency hyperparameters ready
4. **Documentation**: Track all decisions, makes pivoting easier
5. **Communication**: Weekly check-ins on blockers and risks

## Decision Points

### Before Starting Phase 1A
- [ ] Confirm transformer architecture (hidden_dim, n_layers, attention_heads)
- [ ] Decide on TransformerLens version and compatibility
- [ ] Set baseline performance target (accuracy %, grokking timeline)
- [ ] Confirm hardware and W&B setup

### Before Starting Phase 1B
- [ ] Review Phase 1A results and validate grokking
- [ ] Finalize SAE architecture decisions (ReLU, TopK, BatchTopK all needed?)
- [ ] Decide on latent dimensions and sparsity targets
- [ ] Plan dead latent handling strategy

### Before Starting Phase 2
- [ ] Validate Phase 1B on multiple seeds
- [ ] Finalize hyperparameter grid for sweep
- [ ] Set up cloud infrastructure and cost monitoring
- [ ] Plan W&B organization and logging format

### Before Starting Phase 3
- [ ] Inspect sample of trained SAEs for quality
- [ ] Decide on feature matching methodology
- [ ] Plan statistical tests and evaluation metrics
- [ ] Determine comparison baselines

## Honest Assessment: What Could Go Wrong

1. **Transformer may not grok**: Literature suggests it should, but not guaranteed with our dataset
2. **SAE training could be brittle**: Dead latents are known to be problematic; our handling might not scale
3. **Feature consistency might be low**: If features are unstable, the whole analysis is less interesting
4. **Compute costs could exceed budget**: Experiment campaign is the biggest expense risk
5. **Time estimates may be optimistic**: Debugging and iteration often takes longer than planned

### Reality Check
- **Best case**: Everything works as planned, finish in 24 weeks, results are publishable
- **Likely case**: 2-3 unexpected issues, 28-32 weeks total, results are solid but require revisions
- **Worst case**: Major blocker (bad grokking, SAE instability), pivot to different approach, 40+ weeks

---

## Next Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Form team and assign ownership**
   - [ ] Assign Phase 1A lead
   - [ ] Assign Phase 1B lead
   - [ ] Assign Phase 2 infrastructure lead

2. **Finalize Phase 1A design**
   - [ ] Decide on model architecture
   - [ ] Set up TransformerLens compatibility testing
   - [ ] Create initial training script skeleton

3. **Prepare infrastructure**
   - [ ] Set up W&B project and team
   - [ ] Test GPU access and provisioning
   - [ ] Create cloud cost monitoring

4. **Risk mitigation**
   - [ ] Review grokking literature for working hyperparameters
   - [ ] Research dead latent handling techniques
   - [ ] Create failure recovery procedures

---

## Conclusion

The HUSAI project has a solid foundation and a clear path forward. Phase 1 (transformer + SAE implementation) is the critical first step and should be the focus for the next 2-4 weeks. With careful execution and proactive risk management, we can realistically deliver a comprehensive study of SAE feature consistency by early April 2026.

**Key Success Factor**: Staying on schedule for Phase 1. Any delays here cascade to all subsequent phases. Prioritize getting working baseline and SAE code over premature optimization.

**Success looks like**:
- Working end-to-end pipeline by end of Phase 1
- 50+ trained SAEs with reliable tracking by end of Phase 2
- Clear findings on feature consistency by end of Phase 3
- Publication-ready write-up by end of Phase 4

This roadmap is a living document and should be updated as we progress through each phase and learn more about the problem space.
